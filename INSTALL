This is the Perl distribution Alien-bison.

Installing Alien-bison is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm Alien::bison

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S Alien::bison

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan Alien::bison

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build && ./Build test

Then install it:

    % ./Build install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo ./Build install

## Documentation

Alien-bison documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc Alien::bison
